There are two possible approaches to the database scaling:
- **Vertical scaling** – simple server power improvement. It’s simple, but much more expensive and has its limits.
- **Horizontal scaling** – implies performance increasing by data separation to multiple servers. It’s more difficult but provides a fault tolerance.

Types of the horizontal scaling:
- [[Partitioning]]
- [[Sharding]]
- [[Replication]]

[[Federation]]
