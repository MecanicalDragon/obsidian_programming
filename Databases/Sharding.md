**Sharding** is a term used to describe [[partitioning]] to distinct databases (*shards*). That's the only known difference. *Partitioning by key-hash* and *Access pattern* are more intrinsic to the sharding than partitioning.

The main problem of the sharding is difficulty of intershard requests and data balancing.
