**The commutative property** is a math law that says that the order in which we apply a mathematical operation to the operands does not change the result.
**A commutative operation** is a mathematical operation that can be applied to two operands, and the order of the operands does not impact the final result.
`a + b = b + a` ^com

**The associative property** is a math law that says that rearranging the parentheses in an expression does not change the result.
**An associative operation** is a mathematical operation that can be applied to three or more operands, and the order or the grouping of the operands does not impact the final result.
`(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)` ^ass

**The distributive property** is a mathematical law that says that one mathematical operation can be applied to the result of another mathematical operation, and the result does not change if we apply this operation to every operand of the second operation first and apply the second operation to these results after.
**Distributivity** may be *left* `a·(b+c) = a·b + a·c` or *right* `(a+b)·c = a·c + b·c`. If both are valid (operation outside the parenthesis is *commutative*), then distributivity is *full*.
Division, for example is not commutative and has only right-distributivity. ^dis
