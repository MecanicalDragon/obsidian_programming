**Domain Name System** (DNS) is a series of servers located all around the world which store the configuration information of a domain name to provide an ability for TCP/IP users to convert a domain name into an IP address. There are 4 different types of DNS servers involved in a DNS lookup. Each DNS server type has a different role to play and may not all be required under certain circumstances.
- **Recursive Resolver** - This is the DNS server that the computer or device communicates with. This DNS server is typically issued to the client automatically by service provider and is geographically located nearby in order to return results as fast as possible. This server caches DNS record data in order to speed up future DNS lookup requests.
- **Root Nameserver** - This one is responsible for returning the IP address of the *TLD* nameserver. For example, when resolving `example.com`, the root name server will return the IP address of the *TLD* name server responsible for `.com` domain names.
- **Top-Level Domain Nameserver** - *TLD* name server is responsible for returning the authoritative name servers for all domains under the *TLD* it is responsible for. The `.com` *TLD* name server will return results for `example.com` but not `example.org`.
- **Authoritative Nameserver** - This DNS server stores the DNS configuration data of a domain name.

As an example of the flow of events when performing a [[DNS Lookup]], this is the order of events that will happen when you request a URL to visit a website like `example.com` in your web browser.
1. A user types the URL `example.com` into their web browser.
2. Browser first checks its own cache, then checks OS cache for the entry presence.
3. If thereâ€™s no required information, the computer sends a request to the *recursive resolver*.
4. The recursive resolver checks its cache for the requested info, then requests the *root nameserver* which provides the address of the *TLD* nameserver responsible for `.com` domain names.
5. When the root nameserver responds, the recursive resolver sends a request to the `.com` *TLD* nameserver which provides the address of the *authoritative nameserver* responsible for the `example.com` domain.
6. When the *TLD* nameserver responds, the recursive resolver requests the authoritative nameserver responsible for `example.com` which provides the DNS records requested.
7. The authoritative nameserver returns results to the recursive resolver.
8. The recursive resolver returns DNS records containing the IP address to the browser.
9. The browser makes a request directly to the IP address of the server hosting the website.
