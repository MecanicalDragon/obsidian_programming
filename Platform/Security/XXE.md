**XXE** - an XML External Entity attack is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input. This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. Parsed XML documents can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control. Tainted data may be located within the document type declaration (DTD) and point to inner system files.
