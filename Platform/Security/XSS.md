**XSS** â€“ cross-site scripting. This attack implies an inception in web page malicious code that interacts with the malefactor's server being executed on the user's pc when the user opens the web page. [[JWT]] can be stored in the browser in 2 ways: in DOM-storage and in cookies. In the first case the system is vulnerable to XSS attack, because JS has access to DOM-storage and the attacker can extract the token from there. To avoid it you just should keep jwt in the cookies, but it enables another type of an attack.
