**Hadoop MapReduce** is useful to perform calculations on a stream of anything and provide a map with counter results. It is optimized to divide a task among multiple services. *Map* step always breaks a stream of elements to pairs with a counter equal to 1; it will be calculated later on the *Reduce* step.

**Hadoop YARN** is a resource manager of the distributed cluster.
