**Encryption** is a data transformation in order to keep it secret from others. The goal is to ensure the data cannot be consumed by anyone other than the intended recipient. *Encryption* transforms data into another format in such a way that only specific individual(s) can reverse the transformation. It uses a key, which is kept in secret, and the algorithm, in order to perform the encryption operation. As such, the algorithm and key are all required to turn encrypted data back to the plaintext.

**Examples**: AES, Blowfish, [[RSA]]
