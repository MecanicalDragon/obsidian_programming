The routing gateway is responsible for request routing. This gateway implements some API operations by routing requests to the corresponding service. When it receives a request, the gateway consults a routing map that specifies which service to route the request to. A routing map might, for example, map an HTTP method and path to the HTTP URL of service. This function is identical to the reverse proxying features provided by web servers such as NGINX.
