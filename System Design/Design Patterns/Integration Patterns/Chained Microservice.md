There will be multiple dependencies for single service or microservice e.g.: sales microservice has dependency products microservice and order microservice. A chained microservice pattern helps to provide the consolidated outcome to the request. The request received by a ms-1, which is then communicating with ms-2 and it may be communicating with ms-3. All these services are synchronous calls.
