Consider a use case where an application consists of multiple services. Requests often span multiple service instances. Each service instance generates a log file in a standardized format. We need a centralized logging service that aggregates logs from each service instance. Users can search and analyze the logs. They can configure alerts that are triggered when certain messages appear in the logs. An aggregator collects logs from each component (router, controller, etc.) of the platform along with applications.
