Microservices is all about making services loosely coupled, applying the single responsibility principle. This pattern prescribes to decompose applications to services by business capability. A business capability is a concept from [business architecture modeling](https://microservices.io/patterns/decomposition/decompose-by-business-capability.html). It is something that a business does in order to generate value. A business capability often corresponds to a business object, e.g.

- Order Management is responsible for orders
- Customer Management is responsible for customers
- Logistic management
