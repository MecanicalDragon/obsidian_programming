Isolate elements of an application into pools so that if one fails, the others will continue to function. This pattern resembles the sectioned shipâ€™s hull. Divide service instances into different groups, based on consumer load and availability requirements. This design helps to isolate failures and allows to sustain service functionality for some consumers, even during a failure.
