To solve the above concerns, one database per microservice must be designed; it must be private to that service only. It should be accessed by the microservice API only. It cannot be accessed by other services directly. For example, for relational databases, we can use private-tables-per-service, schema-per-service, or database-server-per-service. Hereâ€™re some reasons to use a separate database for microservice:

- **Isolation**: Each microservice can have its own database, which provides a clear separation of concerns. It ensures that each microservice has exclusive control over its data and schema, reducing the chances of data conflicts and minimizing dependencies between services.
- **Autonomy and scalability**: By having separate databases, microservices can operate independently and scale their data storage as needed. Scaling individual databases allows you to allocate resources specifically to the microservice experiencing high demand, without affecting other services.
- **Technology diversity**: Different microservices may have diverse data storage requirements. Using a separate database per microservice allows you to choose the most appropriate database technology for each service's specific needs. For example, one microservice might benefit from a document database, while another may require a graph database.
- **Performance**: A dedicated database can be optimized and tuned specifically for the needs of the microservice it serves. This enables the microservice to perform database operations efficiently without being impacted by the characteristics or load of other services sharing the same database.
- **Maintainability**: Independent databases make it easier to manage and maintain the schema, indexes, and data associated with a particular microservice. Changes to one microservice's database schema or data will not impact other services, reducing the risk of unintended consequences and simplifying the deployment and upgrade process.
- **Data ownership and governance**: Having separate databases aligns with the principle of service ownership and accountability. Each microservice team has control over its own database, facilitating data governance, access control, and security enforcement at the service level.
- **Fault isolation**: In case of a database failure or corruption, having separate databases helps in containing the impact to a specific microservice, reducing the blast radius. It prevents a single point of failure that could bring down multiple services.

It's worth noting that while having a database per microservice offers benefits, it also introduces complexities, such as maintaining data consistency between services and managing data relationships. These challenges often require careful design, coordination, and the use of patterns like event-driven architecture or distributed transactions to ensure data integrity and consistency across the microservices.
