**Lamport clock** (invented by Leslie Lamport in 1978) is a logical clock algorithm used to order events in a distributed system. The algorithm works by incrementing a counter for any system event, and then adding the counter value to the event's message when it is sent between nodes in the system. When a node receives a message, it compares the counter value on the message to its own local counter value and updates its own counter to the greater of the two values. The Lamport clock algorithm has some limitations. Specifically, it cannot distinguish between causally related events and concurrent events that are unrelated to each other. To address this limitation, other logical clock algorithms such as **vector clocks** have been developed.

**Vector clock** was first proposed by computer scientists Leslie Lamport and Robert Shostak in 1982. The vector clock algorithm assigns a vector of logical time to each event in the system, where the vector consists of a logical counter of each node in the system. Each node in the system has its own counter, which is incremented for each event that occurs on that node, and maintains a global system vector vision. When a message is sent from one node to another, it includes the sender’s vector clock. The receiver updates its own counter and global vector vision by taking the maximum of each component’s counter in the received vector clock and its own one.

By comparing the vector clocks of different events, we can determine which events are causally related to each other. Specifically, if the vector clock of one event is less than or equal to the vector clock of another event on all components except for one, then the first event is said to have happened before the second event. The vector clock algorithm is more powerful than the Lamport clock algorithm, because it allows for the detection of causal relationships between events that are not in a simple "happened-before" relationship.
