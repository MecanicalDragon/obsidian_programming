The kubelet uses *liveness probes* to know when to restart a container. For example, liveness probes could catch a deadlock, where an application is running, but unable to make progress. Restarting a container in such a state helps to make the application more available despite bugs. A common pattern for liveness probes is to use the same low-cost HTTP endpoint as for readiness probes, but with a higher failureThreshold. This ensures that the pod is observed as not-ready for some period of time before it is hard killed.

The kubelet uses *readiness probes* to know when a container is ready to start accepting traffic. A Pod is considered ready when all of its containers are ready. One use of this signal is to control which *Pods* are used as backends for Services. When a Pod is not ready, it is removed from Service load balancers.

The kubelet uses *startup probes* to know when a container application has started. If such a probe is configured, liveness and readiness probes do not start until it succeeds, making sure those probes don't interfere with the application startup. This can be used to adopt liveness checks on slow starting containers, avoiding them getting killed by the kubelet before they are up and running.
