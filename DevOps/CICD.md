**Continuous Integration** implies that developers merge their changes back to the main branch as often as possible. The developer's changes are validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build. By doing so, you avoid integration challenges that can happen when waiting for release day to merge changes into the release branch. Continuous integration puts a great emphasis on testing automation to check that the application is not broken whenever new commits are integrated into the main branch.

[Continuous delivery](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery) is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage. This means that on top of automated testing, you have an automated release process and you can deploy your application any time by clicking a button. In theory, with continuous delivery, you can decide to release daily, weekly, fortnightly, or whatever suits your business requirements. However, if you truly want to get the benefits of continuous delivery, you should deploy to production as early as possible to make sure that you release small batches that are easy to troubleshoot in case of a problem.

[Continuous deployment](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-deployment) goes one step further than continuous delivery. With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. There's no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production. Continuous deployment is an excellent way to accelerate the feedback loop with your customers and take pressure off the team as there isn't a Release Day anymore. Developers can focus on building software, and they see their work go live minutes after they've finished working on it.

### Deployment strategies

- **Big Bang Deployment** - just replace one version with another. It can not be done without downtime. In case of errors we can rollback to the old version with downtime again.
- **Blue-Green Deployment** - raise a new version environment simultaneously with the old one. Test it and reroute traffic to the new env. Using this strategy we switch all the traffic from the old version to a new version at a time and can’t do it gradually. Also, it may be difficult to manage the infrastructure resources.
- **Rollout** - gradual replacement of server nodes with new version - increment new one, decrement old one. No downtime, but we can’t control which traffic goes where.
- **Canary Deployment** - higher-level deployment strategy based on the Rollout strategy. The idea behind it is a deployment of the new version only for specific preliminary chosen nodes and routing a specific group of users to it. If everything goes well, we do the rollout for the rest of the nodes.
- **Feature Toggle** - we enable new feature by controlling a specific property. We can make this property distinct for every specific customer to enable the feature granularly and gradually.
