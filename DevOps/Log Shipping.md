A log shipper is a software component or tool that collects, processes, and forwards log data from various sources to a centralized location or target destination. Log shippers are commonly used in distributed systems or environments where logs are generated by multiple applications, servers, or devices. The primary purpose of a log shipper is to efficiently transport log data from source systems to a management system, analytics platform, or storage repository. This is used for centralized log analysis, monitoring, troubleshooting, and compliance auditing. Main purposes of log shippers:
1. **Log Collection**. Log shippers are responsible for collecting log data from different sources, which can include application logs, system logs, server logs, network device logs, or any other log files. They can handle various log formats and protocols, such as plain text logs, JSON logs, Syslog, any other structured log formats.
2. **Log Parsing and Processing**. Once log data is collected, log shippers parse and process the logs to extract relevant information or perform transformations. This can involve tasks like timestamp normalization, log enrichment, filtering, or extracting specific fields from structured logs that will be used for indices building.
3. **Transport and Forwarding**. Log shippers transport the processed log data to the designated destination. Various transport protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP, or message queues can be used to transmit the logs. Shippers may use buffering and reliable delivery mechanisms to handle network disruptions or intermittent connectivity.

Log shippers are designed to handle large volumes of log data generated by distributed systems. They typically provide mechanisms for parallel processing, load balancing, and scalability to ensure efficient log collection and forwarding without impacting system performance. Log shippers are often designed to integrate with popular logging frameworks, libraries, or APIs, making it easier to capture logs from different sources and can be configured from there, or provide native instrumentation for specific platforms or languages. Some popular log shipping tools and frameworks include *Logstash*, *Fluentd*, *Filebeat*, and *Splunk Universal Forwarder*.

Log shippers can be of *PUSH* or *PULL* type. Push and pull log shippers refer to different approaches for transporting log data from source systems to a centralized location or target destination. Each approach has its own benefits and drawbacks, but in some cases, a hybrid approach may be employed, combining elements of both push and pull log shipping to achieve the desired balance.

**Push Log Shippers:**
**Advantages**:
- Real-time data delivery.
- Efficient use of network resources due to log transmission takes place only when there is new data provided.
- Immediate feedback on connectivity, because shippers can quickly detect and report connectivity issues between the source system and destination, allowing for prompt troubleshooting.
**Drawbacks**:
- Tight coupling, because shippers require direct access to the source system's log files or logging framework.
- Additional overhead to the source system, potentially impacting performance.
- Increased complexity due to additional efforts on configuration of logs delivery.

**Pull Log Shippers**:
**Advantages**:
- Pull log shippers operate independently of the source system, allowing the source system to focus solely on generating logs without concern for log shipping mechanisms.
- Graceful handling of network interruptions due to the periodical nature of logs fetching.
- Pull log shippers do not directly impact the source system's performance, as they retrieve logs on their own schedule.
**Drawbacks**:
- Pull log shippers operate on a schedule or interval, meaning there may be a delay between log generation and log retrieval.
- Increased network traffic due to regular polling.
- Additional setup and maintenance on the infra site.
