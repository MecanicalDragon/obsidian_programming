**Obfuscation** is used to make something harder to understand, usually for the purposes of making it more difficult to attack or to copy. One common use is the obfuscation of source code so that it’s harder to replicate a given product if it is reverse engineered. It’s important to note that obfuscation is not a strong control (like properly employed [[Encryption]]) but rather an obstacle. It, like encoding, can often be reversed by using the same technique that obfuscated it.

**Examples**: JavaScript Obfuscator, ProGuard
