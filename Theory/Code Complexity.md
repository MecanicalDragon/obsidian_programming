**Cyclomatic complexity** is a metric, used to indicate the complexity of a program. It is a quantitative measure of the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. Cyclomatic complexity is computed using the control-flow graph of the program: the nodes of the graph correspond to indivisible groups of commands of a program, and a directed edge connects two nodes if the second node command might be or might not be executed after the first node command. Cyclomatic complexity may also be applied to individual functions, modules, methods, or classes within a program.
