- **Inflators** (increase code congestion): long methods, large classes, [primitive obsession](https://refactoring.guru/ru/smells/primitive-obsession), too many method arguments, [data clumps](https://refactoring.guru/ru/smells/data-clumps).
- **OO Design Violators**:
	- Extensive switch/if operators.
	- Object fields that are used rarely and only under specific circumstances.
	- [Refused bequest](https://refactoring.guru/ru/smells/refused-bequest) ([Replace inheritance with delegate](https://refactoring.guru/ru/replace-inheritance-with-delegation)).
	- Different classes with different interfaces do same functionality.
- **Change puzzlers** (affect coupling and cohesion):
	- [Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies](https://refactoring.guru/ru/smells/parallel-inheritance-hierarchies) – every subclass creation for class A requires to create subclass for class B.
	- Divergent Change – small updates inside a class lead to extensive changes all over the class.
	- Shotgun Surgery – small updates in a class lead to a lot of small changes in a lot of other classes.
- **Trashers**: useless classes/wrappers/delegates, garbage comments, duplicated, dead or unused code.
- **Relation entanglers**:
	- Class/method uses another class data or methods more frequently than its own.
	- Cyclic dependency, transitive dependency.
	- Message chain: `a => b() => c() => d()`.
- **Ugly design**:
	- Data storage and business logic functionalities combined in single class.
	- Incomplete functionality of immutable or 3rd-party library class requires additional handlers.

**When to refactor:**
- Rule of Three – when you do something selfsame the third time.
- New feature implementation – it’s easier to understand written code and make it clearer for understanding in future; it’s more obvious how you can implement a feature better and easier.
- Bugfix.
- Code review (better with implementor).
