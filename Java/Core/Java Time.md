**ZoneId** is a representation of the time-zone such as *Europe/Paris*.
**ZoneOffset** extends ZoneId and defines the fixed offset of the current time-zone with GMT/UTC, such as *+02:00*.

**DURATION** is a time-based amount of time, such as *34.5 seconds*.
>This class models a quantity or amount of time in terms of SECONDS and nanoseconds. It can be accessed using other duration-based units, such as MINUTES and HOURS. In addition, the DAYS unit can be used and is treated as exactly equal to 24 hours, thus ignoring daylight savings effects.

**PERIOD** is a date-based amount of time in the **ISO-8601** calendar system, such as *2 years, 3 months and 4 days*.
>This class models a quantity or amount of time in terms of years, months and days. The supported units of a period are YEARS, MONTHS and DAYS. All three fields are always present but may be set to zero.

<br>Durations and periods differ in their treatment of daylight savings time when added to ZonedDateTime. A Duration will add an exact number of seconds, thus a duration of one day is always exactly 24 hours. By contrast, a Period will add a conceptual day, trying to maintain the local time.<br>
For example, consider adding a period of one day and a duration of one day to 18:00 in the evening before a daylight savings gap. The Period will add the conceptual day and result in a ZonedDateTime at 18:00 the following day. By contrast, the Duration will add exactly 24 hours, resulting in a ZonedDateTime at 19:00 the following day (assuming a one-hour DST gap).
