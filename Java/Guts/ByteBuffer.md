**ByteBuffer** is a class that enables manipulations with in-heap and off-heap memory in order to perform [[NIO]] (non-blocking IO) operations. It’s widely used in the NIO library. ByteBuffer can be *direct* or *non-direct*. Non-direct BB works with the JVM heap and can be created with the static `allocate()` method. Direct BB works directly with native memory, interacting with OS IO methods explicitly, bypassing intermediate buffers, and can be created with static `allocateDirect()` method. BB created this way is not served by GC.
